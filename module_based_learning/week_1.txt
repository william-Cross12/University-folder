group rules:

everyone has valid opinions as long as they do their work

everyone is reliable and does what they are meant to do

stick to finishing on time

at start everyone gives their ideas anonimously to enourage everyone to contribute

kick out anyone who isn't doing anything (ignoring all meetings not doing their assigned work)

plan before starting anything

elect a compitent leader (or if there is less people everyone leads)
