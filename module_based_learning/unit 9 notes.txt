to me being a professional means being payed for what you do (e.g: a professional 
artist is payed for their art while an armature artist is not payed and does it as a hobby)

my apparent weaknesses can help me grow by me noticing them and improving on those skills 
so that they are no longer weak boosting me by a lot

record possible weaknesses on the learning journal and try identify ways to improve them
and make a plan possibly or a few ideas of how they could be improved



It's a bit of a new concept, I have had an awarenes before though. I would describe a growth mindset
as the realisation that skills come from gradualy building them with support form others and not that 
skills are set and will never change (life is like an RPG)

having a growth mindset would be beneficial because I would feel happier having a growth mindset than a closed on
as well as constantly improving my skills

cultivating a growth mindset I would probably try do more tutorials then put them into practice 
and maybe try lead a small team or try to to develop leadership skills
