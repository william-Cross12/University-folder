$v0	:

1 = int value being printed
4 = string value being printed
5 = user input
10 = end of program


If have 1, 4 or 5 in $v0 then you need to put
What your returning into $a0 e.g:

li 	$v0, 1
	move 	$a0, $t3
	syscal

1. Loads immediate 1 into $v0
2. Moves the number in $t3 into $a0
3. Runs that print thing


li 	$v0, 4
	la 	$a0, result
	syscall

This does the same as the top one but uses 
the string number 4, and prints the string
Value in result


li 	$v0, 10
	syscall


This ends the program



li $v0, 5
syscall	
move $t0, $v0

This will ask for a user input
Then it will move that input to $t0





Branches are for jumping around the code assembly language like
Jumps are for things like function calls
