I then attended the work based learning module lecture on critical skills and research. I found the exercise on one of the networking module lectures useful as it helped me understand how cisco packet tracer worked.    7 hours total


Monday 11th March:  Today I completed the fourth and fifth lectures for the networking module and learnt how different connectors are used and why as well as how binary and hexadecimal are used in IPV4 and IPV6.
